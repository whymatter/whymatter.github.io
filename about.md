Hey *,

my name is Oliver and I am a computer science student at the university of applied sciences Augsburg (Germany) [www.hs-augsburg.de](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/)

Even if I think that nobody will ever read this site,
I decided to publish some of the stuff I am doing/coding/copy&pasting in my life
in order to have some kind of summary for myself. And maybe someday someone finds an useful snippet of code or at least this page :heart_eyes:
